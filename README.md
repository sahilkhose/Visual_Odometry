The notebook does the following:

1. Extracts features from the photographs taken with a camera setup on the vehicle.

2. Uses the extracted features to find matches between the features in different photographs.

3. Uses the found matches to estimate the camera motion between subsequent photographs.

4. Uses the estimated camera motion to build the vehicle trajectory.
